## Overview

Idea Lab enables ~825 first-year students across 7 branches to form cross-disciplinary teams of 6. The platform replaces manual team assignment with a self-service model:

1. Admin uploads student CSV master data
2. Students register using their USN (validated against CSV)
3. Students create teams or browse/join existing ones
4. Team leads manage invites and join requests
5. Admin monitors progress with real-time stats and gate controls

## Student Flow

### 0. Landing Page (`/`)

- Logged-in users (session in localStorage) are **redirected to `/dashboard`** automatically
- Hero CTA and bottom CTA show "My Dashboard" if logged in, "Register / Login" if not
- Browse Teams link always visible

### 1. Registration (`/register`)

Registration uses a 3-step flow with **email OTP verification** via custom Brevo Email API:

```
Step 1: USN Validation
─────────────────────
Student enters USN
        |
        v
Format validation (1DB25XX###)
        |
        v
Local validUSNs check + Server-side lookup
POST /api/auth/lookup-usn (admin SDK)
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
  Found   Not found
    |       |
    v       v
Show email  "USN not found in
from CSV    student database.
(read-only) Contact admin."
    |       (blocked)
    v
"Send Verification Code" button

Step 2: Email OTP Verification
──────────────────────────────
POST /api/auth/send-otp
  → IP rate limit (5 sends/15min)
  → USN validation + email match
  → Generate 6-digit OTP
  → Store in Firestore otp_codes via admin SDK (10min expiry)
  → Send via Brevo Email API (round-robin multi-key)
        |
        v
Student enters code
        |
        v
POST /api/auth/verify-otp
  → IP rate limit (10 attempts/15min)
  → Validate against Firestore otp_codes
  → Max 5 attempts per code
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
  Valid   Invalid/Expired
    |       |
    v       v
On success: "Invalid or expired
  → Set JWT  code" (retry/resend)
    cookie
  → Create
    Firebase
    custom
    token
    |
    v
60-second resend cooldown

Step 3: Complete Registration (new students)
────────────────────────────────────────────
Confirm name, phone (email locked)
        |
        v
Write to registrations/{USN}
(Firebase Auth active via custom token)
        |
        v
localStorage session + JWT cookie + Firebase Auth
        |
        v
Redirect to /dashboard
```

**Returning students** (USN found in `registrations`):
```
Enter USN → masked email shown → Send OTP → verify → JWT + Firebase Auth → session restored → /dashboard
```

- USN validated against local CSV-derived list + server-side Firebase lookup
- Email verified via custom OTP (Brevo API + Firestore admin SDK) before registration completes
- Returning students see masked email (e.g., `r****l@dbit.in`) and skip registration fields
- Name, email, phone auto-filled from CSV; phone is editable and required (10 digits)
- Branch and section derived from USN automatically

### 2. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

Protected by `SessionGuard` — validates JWT cookie via `initializeAuth()`, then validates session against Firestore on load and syncs stale `teamId`/`teamRole`.

**Welcome Header** — first-name greeting with branch, section, and USN.

**Pending Invites** — shows all incoming team invites with "Respond" links.

**Leader Panel** (when user is team lead):
- Team name heading with team ID badge
- Leader avatar card with initials, name, USN, branch info
- `TeamStatusBadge` and `BranchConstraintIndicator` shared components
- Member list with Joined/Waiting status indicators
- **Edit mode** toggle to manage pending invites:
  - Remove pending invites
  - Direct invite up to 3 friends by USN (with branch constraint validation via `canAddMember()`)
  - USN lookup checks `registrations` first, then `students` fallback
- Open slot indicators showing remaining capacity
- Progress bar visualizing team completion (joined vs waiting vs total)
- Team ID sharing note for browse discoverability

**Member Panel** (when user is a non-lead team member):
- Team name, ID, member count, and status badge
- Branch constraint indicator
- Link to full team page

**No Team Card** — shown when user has no team, with Create Team and Browse Teams actions.

**Quick Actions** — grid of cards linking to Create Team, Browse Teams, and Check Status.

### 3. Create Team (`/team/create`)

```
Student clicks "Create Team"
        |
        v
Check: teamFormationOpen gate
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
  Open    Closed
    |       |
    v       v
Show form  "Team Formation
    |       Closed" (locked)
    v
Set team name (optional)
Set visibility (public/private)
        |
        v
Generate TEAM-XXXX ID
        |
        v
Write teams/{TEAM-XXXX} doc
Update registrations/{USN}.teamId
Update localStorage session
        |
        v
Redirect to /team/{TEAM-XXXX}
```

- Student becomes **team lead**
- Team starts with 1 member (the lead) in "forming" status
- Public teams appear in browse; private teams are invite-only

### 4. Team Management (`/team/[teamId]` + Dashboard)

**Team Lead can:**
- Invite up to 3 members directly by USN from the Dashboard (edit mode)
  - Branch constraint validation via `canAddMember()` before sending
  - USN lookup checks `registrations` → `students` fallback
  - Uses shared `generateInviteId()` (unambiguous charset)
- Invite members by USN from the team page (creates invite doc, type: "invite")
- Approve/reject join requests from browse page
- See real-time constraint indicator (branch slots, EEE/ECE check)
- Remove pending invites in edit mode

**All Members can:**
- View team members with status badges (Joined/Invited/Requested)
- See branch distribution and constraint progress

### 5. Browse & Join (`/team/browse`)

```
Student opens Browse Teams
        |
        v
Check: teamFormationOpen gate
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
  Open    Closed
    |       |
    v       v
Fetch public  "Team Formation
forming teams  Closed" (locked)
    |
    v
Filter/search by name, ID, branch
    |
    v
Click "Request to Join"
    |
    v
Create invites/{INV-XXXXXX} (type: "request")
Add as pending_request member in team
    |
    v
Team lead reviews in their team page
```

### 6. Invite Response (`/invite/[inviteId]`)

When a team lead invites a student:
- Student sees invite details (team name, lead name, current members)
- Accept: updates invite status, adds to team members, updates registration
- Reject: updates invite status, removes pending member from team

---

## Admin Flow

### 1. Login (`/admin`)

- Firebase email/password authentication
- Only authorized admin emails can access
- Responsive sidebar (desktop) / top tabs (mobile) navigation

### 2. Dashboard Tab

- **Total Registrations** — count of `registrations` collection
- **CSV Students** — count of `students` collection (imported records)
- **Teams Forming** — teams with status "forming"
- **Teams Full** — teams with status "full" or "locked"
- **Branch Distribution** — horizontal bar chart showing registrations per branch

### 3. Students Tab

Upload student master data via CSV:

```
Click/drag CSV file
        |
        v
Client-side parse (csvParser.ts)
        |
        v
Preview table (Name, USN, Mobile, Email, Branch)
        |
        v

        |
        v
Batch write to students/{USN}
(450 docs per Firestore batch)
        |
        v
Update config.csvLastUploadedAt
```

### 4. Registrations Tab

- Columns: Name, USN, Branch, Section, Team ID, Team Role
- **Export CSV** — downloads all data as `.csv`
- **Export XLS** — downloads all data as `.xlsx` (via xlsx library)
- **Reload Data** button for manual refresh

### 5. Teams Tab

- Filtered view of students who are assigned to teams
- Shows Team ID and Role (Lead/Member) columns

### 6. Admins Tab

- **Authorize Admin** — add email to admin whitelist
- **Authorized Staff** — list current admins with revoke option
- Cannot revoke your own admin access

### 7. Settings Tab

- **Registration Gate** — toggle student registrations open/closed
- **Team Formation Gate** — toggle team creation and joining open/closed
- **Danger Zone** — reset database (requires password re-authentication + type "reset database")
  - Always deletes all `registrations`, `teams`, and `invites` documents
  - Optional: **Clear OTP codes** — checked by default
  - Optional: **Clear CSV student master data** (`students` collection) — unchecked by default
  - Does NOT delete `admins` or `config`

---

## Team Constraints

| Rule | Value | Enforcement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Team size | Exactly **6** members | Hard block at 6 |
| Max same branch | **4** from one branch | Blocked when adding 5th |
| Min different branches | **2** unique branches | Checked at completion |
| EEE/ECE requirement | At least **1** member | Warning until 6th member, then hard block |

Constraints are validated in real-time during team building via `teamConstraints.ts`:
- `canAddMember(members, newBranch)` — checks before adding
- `validateTeamComposition(members)` — full validation
- `getBranchDistribution(members)` — returns `{ CSE: 2, IOT: 1, ... }`

---

## CSV Format

### Standard Format

```csv
Name,USN,Mobile,Email
Rahul Sharma,1DB25CS001,9876543210,rahul.s@dbit.in
Priya Patel,1DB25EC042,9123456789,priya.p@dbit.in
Arjun Kumar,1DB25IS100,8765432190,arjun.k@dbit.in
```

### Column Rules

| Column | Required | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `Name` | Yes | Student full name |
| `USN` | Yes | Must match format `1DB25XX###` |
| `Mobile` | No | 10-digit phone number. Also accepts header `Phone` |
| `Email` | No | Student email address |
| `Branch` | No | Auto-derived from USN if omitted |
| `Section` | No | Auto-derived from USN if omitted |

### Parsing Behavior

- Column order does not matter — matched by header name (case-insensitive)
- Handles quoted fields (`"Doe, John"` works correctly)
- Empty USN or Name rows are skipped with per-row error reporting
- Branch/section auto-derived from USN using DBIT 2025 section mapping
- Upload is batched at 450 docs per Firestore write (limit is 500)

---

## USN Format & Branch Mapping

USN format: `1DB25{BRANCH_CODE}{ROLL_NUMBER}`

| Code | Branch | Full Name |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `CS` | CSE | Computer Science & Engineering |
| `IC` | IOT | Internet of Things |
| `CI` | AI&ML | Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning |
| `AD` | AI&DS | AI & Data Science |
| `IS` | ISE | Information Science & Engineering |
| `EC` | ECE | Electronics & Communication |
| `EE` | EEE | Electrical & Electronics |

### Section Mapping (DBIT 2025)

Sections are determined by branch code and roll number range:

| Branch | Roll Range | Section |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| CS | 001–059 | A |
| CS | 060–118 | B |
| CS | 119–177 | C |
| CS | 178–197 | D |
| IC | 001–037 | D |
| CI | 001–061 | E |
| CI | 062–100 | F |
| AD | 001–024 | F |
| AD | 025–087 | G |
| IS | 001–066 | I |
| IS | 067–130 | J |
| IS | 131–194 | K |
| EC | 001–053 | L |
| EC | 054–108 | M |
| EC | 109–163 | N |
| EE | 001–045 | P |

Example: `1DB25CS075` → Branch: **CSE**, Section: **B**

    |<-- "X students imported" --|
```

---

## Gate Control System

Admins control two independent gates from the Settings tab:

| Gate | Controls | When Closed |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Registration Gate** | `/register` page | Shows "Registrations Closed" with lock icon |
| **Team Formation Gate** | `/team/create` and `/team/browse` | Shows "Team Formation Closed" with lock icon |

Both gates are stored in `config/global_config` document:

```json
{
  "registrationsOpen": true,
  "teamFormationOpen": true,
  "csvLastUploadedAt": "..."
}
```

Gates take effect immediately — no restart required. Students see a locked state with a message explaining why access is restricted.

### Design System: Paper & Ink

Minimal, print-inspired aesthetic using CSS custom properties:

| Variable | Value | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `--ink` | `#0D0D0D` | Text, borders, primary actions |
| `--paper` | `#F2EFE9` | Background |
| `--paper2` | `#E8E4DD` | Secondary background |
| `--red` | `#E8341A` | Accent, errors, danger |
| `--muted` | `#7A7670` | Secondary text |
| `--line` | `rgba(13,13,13,0.12)` | Subtle borders |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in Firebase client config, Firebase Admin service account key,
# JWT secret, Brevo API key, and admin emails

# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32
# Paste output as JWT_SECRET in .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Deploy Firestore rules (after all code is deployed)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with your config (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Firebase Client SDK
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Firebase Admin SDK (server-side only)
# Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate New Private Key
# Paste the entire JSON as a single-line string
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=

# JWT Session Secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_SECRET=

# Admin emails (comma-separated)
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@dfriendsclub.in

# Brevo Email API (single key)
BREVO_API_KEY=
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=

# Brevo Multi-key (optional — round-robin with auto-fallback)
# BREVO_KEYS=apikey1:sender1@email.com,apikey2:sender2@email.com

# Origin allowlist (comma-separated, optional)
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://idealab.dfriendsclub.in,http://localhost:3000
```

### Firebase Admin Setup

1. Go to Firebase Console → **Project Settings → Service Accounts**
2. Click **Generate New Private Key** — downloads a JSON file
3. Paste the entire JSON (as a single line) into `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
4. This enables server-side Firestore access and custom token creation

### Brevo Setup

1. Create a free account at [brevo.com](https://brevo.com) (300 emails/day)
2. Go to **Settings → Senders & IPs → Senders** — add and verify your sender email
3. Go to **Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys** — generate an API v3 key
4. Copy the API key and verified sender email into `.env.local`
5. For higher volume, create multiple Brevo accounts and use `BREVO_KEYS` for round-robin

> **Fallback mechanism**: If `BREVO_KEYS` is set, the system distributes emails across keys in round-robin fashion. If one key fails (rate limit, error), it automatically tries the next key.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **JWT Cookie** | `idealab_token` (httpOnly, SameSite=lax, HS256) | Server-side session — verified by middleware |
| **Firebase Custom Token** | Created by admin SDK on OTP verify | Client-side Firestore auth — enforces security rules |
| **localStorage** | `idealab_session` (UI data cache) | Fast client-side rendering of user info |

### Auth Flow

1. Student verifies OTP → server creates JWT cookie + Firebase custom token
2. Middleware checks JWT on protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/team/create`)
3. `AuthProvider` restores Firebase Auth from JWT cookie on page load
4. `SessionGuard` validates JWT + Firestore record before rendering
5. Logout clears all three layers (cookie + Firebase signOut + localStorage)

### Route Protection (Middleware)

| Route | Protection |
|-------|-----------|
| `/dashboard/*`, `/team/create/*` | JWT cookie required → redirect to `/register` |
| `/admin/*` | Passes through (uses own Firebase email/password auth) |
| `/api/*` | Origin checking (blocks cross-origin requests) |
| All routes | Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) |

### API Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `POST /api/auth/send-otp` | 5 requests per IP | 15 minutes |
| `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` | 10 attempts per IP | 15 minutes |
| Per-OTP attempts | 5 attempts | Until expired |
| Per-email cooldown | 1 OTP | 60 seconds |

### Firestore Security Rules

All client-side Firestore access requires Firebase Auth (`auth != null`). Key authorization rules:

- **registrations**: Only self can create/update; team lead can set `teamId`/`teamRole`
- **invites**: Only `fromUSN` can create; only participants can update
- **notifications**: Only recipient can read/update; `fromUSN` must match creator
- **otp_codes**: Client access denied (admin SDK only)
- **config**: Publicly readable (non-sensitive status flags)
- **students**: Read-only for authenticated users

Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Security Headers

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Frame-Options` | DENY |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | nosniff |
| `Referrer-Policy` | strict-origin-when-cross-origin |
| `Permissions-Policy` | camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=() |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Restricts scripts, styles, fonts, connections |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains |
| `X-Powered-By` | Removed |

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| USN not in CSV | "USN not found in student database" — registration blocked |
| Network error on USN lookup | "Could not verify USN" — registration blocked |
| OTP send failure | Error message shown, can retry |
| Invalid/expired OTP | "Invalid or expired code" — can retry or resend after 60s cooldown |
| Team full (6 members) | Join/invite blocked |
| 5th same-branch member | `canAddMember()` returns false |
| Team complete without EEE/ECE | Warning during building, hard block at 6th member |
| Already on a team | "You're already on a team" with link to current team |
| Duplicate join request | "You already have a pending request for this team" |
| Race condition (team filled during invite) | Final `canAddMember()` check before Firestore write |
| CSV parse errors | Per-row error reporting with row numbers |
| Database reset | Requires password re-auth + confirmation phrase |
